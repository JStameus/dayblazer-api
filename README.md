# Dayblazer Calendar
A calendar and planner app where you can take on optional side-quests, collect
achievements and make life a little more adventurous!

This is a school project, where the task is to create a full-stack application
using Nodejs, HTML and CSS, with the end result being a usable calendar of some
sort.

## Overview

This is the back-end part of my project, which will handle the loading of
resources, such as user-created events, user profiles(if I can manage it), and
other relevant data that makes the other half of the project work.
